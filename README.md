# Tailwind CSS and JavaScript Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning **Tailwind CSS** and **JavaScript** through the **Geekster** courses.

## About Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design and build responsive web applications with ease. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that offer predefined components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that enable you to construct custom designs directly in your HTML. This approach promotes a more efficient workflow and fosters consistency across your projects.

### Key Features of Tailwind CSS:
- **Utility-First:** Use single-purpose utility classes to style elements directly in your markup.
- **Responsive Design:** Easily create responsive layouts with built-in responsive utilities.
- **Customization:** Tailwind is highly customizable, allowing you to define your color palette, spacing, and other design tokens.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Built-in support for dark mode styling with ease.

### About the Geekster Course on Tailwind CSS

## About the JavaScript Course

The **Geekster** course on JavaScript is designed to help learners grasp the **basics of JavaScript**, an essential language for web development. This course covers foundational concepts that enable developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

### What You'll Learn:
